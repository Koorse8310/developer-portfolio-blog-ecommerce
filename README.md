## ⚠ you should use develop branch for latest codebase.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Setup local developement**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new developer-portfolio-starter https://github.com/Rajesh-Royal/developer-portfolio-blog-ecommerce
    ```

    **or**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Rajesh-Royal/developer-portfolio-blog-ecommerce
    cd developer-portfolio-blog-ecommerce/
    yarn install
    yarn start
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd developer-portfolio-blog-ecommerce/
    gatsby develop or yarn start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `developer-portfolio-blog-ecommerce` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── .eslintrc.json
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json

    └── README.md

1.  **`/.vscode`**: This directory contains all of the workspace setting for vscode.

2.  **`/..github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES`**: This directory contains all of the Templates for ISSUES to this repository, there is two templates feature-request.md and bug-report.md.

3.  **`.eslintrc.json`**: This file contains all the linting rules for this project.

4.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

5.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

6.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

7.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

8.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

9.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

10. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

11. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

12. **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

13. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

14. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

15. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with GATSBY [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to GATSBY documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
